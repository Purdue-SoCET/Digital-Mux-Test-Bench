1,Reset Timer ,Toggle n_rst low to verify mux initailizes to applied reset signal. Registers should read 0's. ,,Output ,1,100,
2,Reset Bus,"Toggle inputs low (psel, penable, pwrite, paddr, pwdata, pstrb, from_module, output_enable, to_module_iopad. ",,Input,1,100,
3,Execute Transactions,,,,1,100,
3.1,Address Phase ,Set enable to 0 and toggle other phase inputs on.  ,,Input,1,100,
3.2,Write Info,"Check if write is set high, if so begin to send all of the PDATA into the bus. ",,Input,1,100,
3.3,Access Phase ,Set enable high and check If generated PSLVERR is equal to expected PSLVERR. ,,Input,1,100,
4,Send and Monitor,,,,1,100,
4.1,Sending Data ,"Set sync high to begin and send data into the input dataline. If sync remains high, output_enable and from_module will receive the input dataline.  ",,Output,1,100,
4.2,Monitoring Data,"Iterate through all 32 bits and continue to check if sync is high. When hign, outputs can receive the monitored data. Must then verify data by checking if the monitored data is equviliant to what in included in the data array. ",,Output,1,100,
5,Write/Read,,,,1,100,
5.1,Write into register,Write into register by setting PWRITE and PSTRB high with each fsel set to 2'b10. ,,Input,1,100,
5.2,Read from register,Read from register by setting PWRITE AND PSTRB low. Iterate through number of pins and utilize send and monitor case to verify if data was written and read properly. ,,Output,1,100,
6,PSLVERR Test,Excute numerous tranasctions to check if an error condition is processed. Must repeate read and write functions to test this. ,,Output,1,100,
7,PSTRB Test,Execute write functions to check if sparse data transfer on write data bus is enabled. ,,Input,1,100,
8,Reset DUT Test,Set n_rst on the DUT to low and output registers should read default values.  ,,Input,1,100,
